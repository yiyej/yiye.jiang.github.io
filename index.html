I am currently a temporary teacher resarcher (ATER) at Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux. I did my thesis under the supervision of Jérémie Bigot and Sofian Maabout at Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux as well. The manuscrit will be available online soon. 

My research works concern the development of new statistical modelas and inference methods for diverse and complex types of data, such as spatio-temporal, matrix-variate, distributional data. I am recently very interested in object data analysis and its applications in neuroscience.
