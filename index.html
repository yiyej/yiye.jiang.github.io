I am a PhD student at Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux, under the supervision of Jérémie Bigot and Sofian Maabout. 

My research works lie in time series analysis with the graph emphasis. I am recently interested in modelling the distributional time series.

<p> I am also interested in more general machine learning and solving the problems motived by the real-world applications.
