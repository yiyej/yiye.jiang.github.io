I am currently a postdoc at <a href="https://team.inria.fr/statify/">Statify</a>, joint team of Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann & Centre Inria de l'Université Grenoble Alpes. I did my thesis under the supervision of Jérémie Bigot and Sofian Maabout at Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux.

My research is at the interface of time series analysis, complex data analysis, and graph learning. Examples of data that I deal with are time series of matrices and time series of probability distributions. 
I am recently incoporating Bayesian modeling in the analysis. My main applications include fMRI analysis, brain functional connectivity networks inference, demorgraphic data analysis.
