I am currently a temporary teacher resarcher (ATER) at Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux. I did my thesis under the supervision of Jérémie Bigot and Sofian Maabout at Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux as well. The manuscrit will be available online soon. 

My research works lie in time series analysis with the graph emphasis. I am recently interested in modelling the distributional time series. 
</p>
<p> I am also interested in more general machine learning and solving the problems motivated by the real-world applications.
